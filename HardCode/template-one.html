                <p> Subject 254 shows promising results. It's core is stable, however cannot function without the constant supervision and monitering of the power suit. Combustion is eminent when not equiped. Subject's functionality is tied soley to its left arm. Further development needed to impliment ambidextrous power usage.</p>

                <p> There has been a problem. The lab location has been discovered by Astarne. Evacuation must happen imediatly. Subject 254 must be left behind. 254 is too dangerous and unstable to be left alone, so mechanical hounds will guard the lab. If 254 exits the lab, hounds will kill on sight. If the entryway is opened, hounds will kill intruder on sight.</p>

                <h2>Ava Byriden</h2>
                <p>Ava has exibited signs of a potential power source that could be used for my experiments. In the short time I have observed her, she seems to be able to give small objects an extra bit of energy, such as a battery or lightbulb. Further observation led to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stronger than normal reactions from thermal or electrical sources when Ava touches them</li>
                    <li>Constant static shocking when touching electrical equipment in the lab</li>
                    <li>A perpetual motion machine working, only when she touched it</li>
